      Having a website is a cost-effective approach when it
      comes to advertising and reaching out to potential
      customers. Till now, the only way through which small
      businesses reached outside the local area was through
      expensive advertising media. Many companies can't afford
      expensive TV advertising or national magazines. But with
      a website companies can reach out to a vast audience
      throughout the world.

        You are completely aware of your services and what your

        references such as brochures, logos, photographs,
        product prescription business cards will be required for
        the contents to be present on your website.

        "17.  What is the difference between Static Web Design and Dynamic Web Design?",
      answer: `    <div className="accordion-body">
      <p>
        Static WebPages are the ones that always look the same
        and their content rarely changes. To make a change you
        need to create the page yourself or get help from a
        designer. The newly created pages and any images must
        then be uploaded to the web servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Dynamic Pages can be changed every time they
        are loaded and the contents can also be changed as per
        your requirements. The dynamic page can be created to
        respond to the user queries and can also reduce ongoing
        maintenance costs if you don't want to change things
        yourself with a page editor. A content management
        utility also needs to be developed to help you manage
        your sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many clients have a combination of both dynamic and
        static elements in their sites. For instance, they might
        use dynamic pages for product catalogs where they can
        change information or pictures regularly. "Contact" and
        "About Us" web pages often left as static pages.

      around diverse aspects. The cost for launching and
      designing starts from USD 400 onwards depending upon
      scope of work whereas the cost for routine maintenance

      <p>
        <strong>Types of Web Design Layouts:</strong>
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3">
        <strong>Static Website Layout:</strong> In this type,
        the web pages involve limited content. Each page is
        created using HTML language and represents the same
        information to all its visitors. These are perceived to
        be the most primitive type of websites that are easiest
        to create. Unlike dynamic websites require web
        programming or database designs whereas static websites
        do not require them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dynamic Website Layout:</strong> This type of
        web design is designed with a variety of pieces that
        collectively form a page. These are distinct from static
        sites as they use server technologies, like PHP or
        JavaScript, for web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fixed Width Layout:</strong> Unique feature
        mentioned in the name itself, these websites start with
        a specific size as stipulated by the web designer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The width remains stable regardless of the size of the
        browser window viewing the page. This fixed-width
        control feature provides the control of the look of the
        page to the designer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Responsive Design Layout:</strong> This is a
        single layout design that is included in all the web
        pages in which the elements get reformatted and resized
        based on the breakpoints. A breakpoint is a specific
        viewport width value (in pixels) that triggers a
        transition in the website layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Liquid or Fluid Design Layout:</strong> In this
        type of layout, the webpage resizes as the window size
        is altered. This is possible using percentages instead
        of pixels width for defining areas. The number of
        columns in most of the webpages are one, two or three.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Single Page Design Layout:</strong> In this
        layout, there is only one HTML page containing just the
        exact information that a user needs to make a decision
        and act on it. These layouts are preferred for landing
        pages, portfolios, and event-related websites.

      page and the features of the asset. The average cost of
      website designing for small businesses ranges starts

                        thorough evaluation of all the components incorporate

                        a triumph for a business. It portrays a lot about you to
                        the users for instance the concept behind the business,
                        target audience, etc. Visitors will contribute cash for

                        Static WebPages are the ones that always look the same
                        and their content rarely changes. To make a change you
                        need to create the page yourself or get help from a
                        designer. The newly created pages and any images must
                        then be uploaded to the web servers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, Dynamic Pages can be changed every time they
                        are loaded and the contents can also be changed as per
                        your requirements. The dynamic page can be created to
                        respond to the user queries and can also reduce ongoing
                        maintenance costs if you don't want to change things
                        yourself with a page editor. A content management
                        utility also needs to be developed to help you manage
                        your sites.

                      <p>
                        Many clients have a combination of both dynamic and
                        static elements in their sites. For instance, they might
                        use dynamic pages for product catalogs where they can
                        change information or pictures regularly. "Contact" and
                        "About Us" web pages often left as static pages.

                        scope of work whereas the cost for routine maintenance

                        <strong>Static Website Layout:</strong> In this type,
                        the web pages involve limited content. Each page is
                        created using HTML language and represents the same
                        information to all its visitors. These are perceived to
                        be the most primitive type of websites that are easiest
                        to create. Unlike dynamic websites require web
                        programming or database designs whereas static websites
                        do not require them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>Dynamic Website Layout:</strong> This type of
                        web design is designed with a variety of pieces that
                        collectively form a page. These are distinct from static
                        sites as they use server technologies, like PHP or
                        JavaScript, for web development.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Fixed Width Layout:</strong> Unique feature
                        mentioned in the name itself, these websites start with
                        a specific size as stipulated by the web designer.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The width remains stable regardless of the size of the
                        browser window viewing the page. This fixed-width
                        control feature provides the control of the look of the
                        page to the designer.

                        <strong>Responsive Design Layout:</strong> This is a
                        single layout design that is included in all the web
                        pages in which the elements get reformatted and resized
                        based on the breakpoints. A breakpoint is a specific
                        viewport width value (in pixels) that triggers a
                        transition in the website layout.

                      <p>
                        <strong>Liquid or Fluid Design Layout:</strong> In this
                        type of layout, the webpage resizes as the window size
                        is altered. This is possible using percentages instead
                        of pixels width for defining areas. The number of
                        columns in most of the webpages are one, two or three.

                        <strong>Single Page Design Layout:</strong> In this
                        layout, there is only one HTML page containing just the
                        exact information that a user needs to make a decision
                        and act on it. These layouts are preferred for landing
                        pages, portfolios, and event-related websites.

                        The cost of a website depends on the elements of the
                        page and the features of the asset. The average cost of
                        website designing for small businesses ranges starts
                        from US$ 250 onwards. The costs may vary with the
                        requirement of any additional features or custom-built
                        components.

                        frequently used software like Adobe Photoshop, Figma or
