                                        Unlike websites and web applications, native apps don’t run in the browser. You need to download them from platform specific app stores such as Google Play or Apple’s App Store. If you intend to build an iOS app, for example, app developers need to use programming languages like Objective C or Swift. Similarly, for Android apps, developers use C++ or Java or Kotlin programming languages.</p>

Here the difference is that, the app is run within the native application using its own embedded browser, essentially invisible to the user. For example, an Android application would use WebView to display the application, while on iOS, it would use the WKWebView to do the same function.</p>

                            Improving data security is another strategy to perform mobile application development.
